## Description
Given a "Beer Dashboard" with form inputs, when I search for a city. I am presented with a list of nearby breweries. When I click the search button the closest brewery is displayed followed by a list of other breweries. When I click on a brewery, I am presented with a details of the brewery. When I click on a starred brewery recommended by others I can add it to my favorites and the favorites are stored to local storage.

## User Story
As an avid connoisseur of crafted beer from around the world.
I want a web application that finds nearby breweries with pricing and a list of the types of craft beers available.
So that I can find nearby ones, but also ones that are off the grid and not as well known.
