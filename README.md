## Description

Search by city for local breweries! Type in your city to find contact information and websites for breweries close by. Star the breweries you like to save them to your favorites!

## User Story

```py
AS AN avid connoisseur of crafted beer from around the world.
I WANT a web application that finds nearby breweries with pricing and a list of the types of craft beers available.
SO THAT I can find nearby ones, but also ones that are off the grid and not as well known.
```
